SNP Calling Pipeline Information:
Use the sample configurations as a guideline for your own (if tweaking.) Several viewings of the perl script files may be necessary.

QC and Pre Steps:
0. Always check FastQC either after Combine/Deinterleave or after 5' Trimming, but always before 3' Trimming.
1. Check the library sizes with QC_GetLibrarySizes. It should return a number that is divisible by 4.
2. If necessary use either of the two Pre steps:
   - Combine is to concatenate together accession files which have been separated.
   - Deinterleave is to separate a FastQ file into two separate Read 1 and Read 2 files while maintaining order.
     * Deinterleave now uses findFastq.pl in Tools, it is a perl script used to separate the Reads via capture strings.
RUN STEPS:
1. RUN1_PrepareReferences will index your genome file. We used Bowtie2 for the standard pipeline.
2. RUN2_ManageFiltering_byDirectory will take your FastQ files, 3p and 5p trim them and then separate the pairs and orphans.
   - 5pTrim uses Henry's script to remove the first 15 nucleotides because the sequencer doesn't read them right.
   - Check if the new sequencer has the same problem.
   - 3pTrim uses the fastq_quality_trimmer in the fastx_toolkit.
3. RUN3_AlignToReferences will take your filtered FastQ read pairs and align them to the Bowtie2 indices/reference genome.
   - Using the output from RUN1 of the indexed reference from Bowtie2, use Bowtie2 to align the references.
   - Afterwards, sort the Bowtie2 aignment with samtools (it's been made a bam)
   - The sorted bam is indexed after sorting.
   - Henry's ContigDepths script is called, not sure if necessary.
4. RUN4_WrapDelly is not necessary for calling SNPs (at this point) [not used at all]
5. RUN5_CallSNPS will call SNPs with the output from aligning, .bam and sorted bam and indexed files (not the same as Bowtie2 indexed files)
   - Run samtools mpileup with mostly default settings on the sorted Bowtie2 bam file, then pipe into bcftools to a raw vcf file.
6. RUN6_ParseOutput will parse the output into a more human-readable format. [I don't use ParseOutput]
7. RUN7_Variant_Annotation will call either variant effect predictor or annovar or both as an option.


Optional:
There are two optional phred quality score guessing scripts in the Scripts folder. One is in Python and the other one is in Perl. If you already know the quality score for your FastQ files then ignore them, but if you can't make an educated guess see if these two scripts may help you. This is important. I ran scripts several times scratching my head as to why it wasn't trimming! The command line parameters were all correct! Turns out I was trimming for Phred+33 not Phred+64. Know your Phred Quality Scores and to which brand it applies to!
