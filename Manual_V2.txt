SNP Calling Pipeline Information:
Use the sample configurations as a guideline for your own (if tweaking.) Several viewings of the script files may be necessary.
You will need to replace the paths to where the files will be stored.

QC and Pre Steps:
0. Always check FastQC either after Combine/Deinterleave or after 5' Trimming, but always before 3' Trimming.
   - Always check FastQC after and before any major changes that will be made to the fastq files.
1. Check the library sizes with QC_GetLibrarySizes. It should return a number that is divisible by 4.
2. If necessary use either of the two Pre steps:
   - Combine is to concatenate together accession files which have been separated.
   - Deinterleave is to separate a FastQ file into two separate Read 1 and Read 2 files while maintaining order.
     * Deinterleave now uses findFastq.pl in Tools, it is a perl script used to separate the Reads via capture strings.
     * Usage is specified if you just run perl findFastq.pl
     
RUN STEPS:
1. RUN1_PrepareReferences will index your genome file.
   - We used Bowtie2 for the standard pipeline with default parameters.
2. RUN2_ManageFiltering_byDirectory will take your FastQ files, 3p and 5p trim them and then separate the pairs and orphans.
   - 5pTrim uses Henry's script to remove the first 15 nucleotides because Illumina sequencing's first 15 nts are never good.
   - Check if the new sequencer has the same problem (when we get new reads)
   - 3pTrim uses the fastq_quality_trimmer in the fastx_toolkit.
3. RUN3_AlignToReferences will take your filtered FastQ read pairs and align them to the Bowtie2 indices/reference genome.
   - Using the output from RUN1 of the indexed reference from Bowtie2, use Bowtie2 to align the references.
   - Final step with Reads, from here on out only the BAM file. Reads will be gzipped automatically.
   - Bowtie2 in here is set to very sensitive so it takes longer but is more accurate.
4. RUN4_PrepBAM takes the alignment BAM, sorts it, replaces duplicates, and adds/replaces read groups.
   - The Read Groups are currently dummy read groups and can be changed if one has information about flowcell, sequencer, and lane for your reads. GATK2's documentation on read groups is good for this.
5. RUN5_GATK2 runs the prepped bam file through the Genome Analysis Toolkit:
   - Targettig intervals where it might be best to realign indels.
   - Realigning those intervals.
   - Calling SNPS with HaplotypeCaller.
     * Currently it is set to discover snps and emit all sites whether they are high or low quality. These settings can be changed in the configuration file.
6. RUN6_VEP will take the vcf and call possible effects of SNPs on those sites.
   - The functions to make the cache database and convert to gtf are preliminary and only work for certain files. It is not recommended to use them. The configuration file has their options set to 0 for that reason.
   - If using a species that does not exist in the database, you will have to create your own cache database from a gtf file. The creation of the database is a straight VEP perl script, however, converting from gff to gtf is not so straightforward.


Notes:


Optional:
There are two optional phred quality score guessing scripts in the Scripts folder. One is in Python and the other one is in Perl. If you already know the quality score for your FastQ files then ignore them, but if you can't make an educated guess see if these two scripts may help you. This is important. I ran scripts several times scratching my head as to why it wasn't trimming! The command line parameters were all correct! Turns out I was trimming for Phred+33 not Phred+64. Know your Phred Quality Scores and to which brand it applies to!
